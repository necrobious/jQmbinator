	This xhtml document is marked up to provide the designer with the maximum possible flexibility.
	There are more classes and extraneous tags than needed, and in a real world situation, it's more
	likely that it would be much leaner.
	
	However, I think we can all agree that even given that, we're still better off than if this had been
	built with tables.

	CSS Zen Garden Markup: Recreated in jQmbinator. (http://www.csszengarden.com/)
	
	This is an example of how you can build large amounts of markup programmatically using jQmbinator.
	every div, a, h2, span, etc element is a jQuery object that can be used as you normally would.
	You get the full power of javascript to handle all of your templating needs. No template language crapola!
	functions, literal object definitions, and jQuery make even the most complex tempating needs trivial,
	with out adding anything new, only using what you already know.
